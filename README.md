Hi! I'm Hugh, I'm a 2nd year PhD student at the University of Queensland working in the exciting world of Numerical Astro-Statistics. My current speciality is the reveberation mapping of active galactic nuclei broad line regions, but I also work more generally in bayesian stats methods and modern programming tools like `JAX` and `NumPyro`.

You can check out an overview of my work at [my website](https://hughmcdougall.github.io/), where you'll also find my [blog](https://hughmcdougall.github.io/blog/bloghome.html) on stats and `NumPyro`.

If you need to get a hold of me, don't hesistate to shoot me an [email](hughmcdougallemail@gmail.com).
